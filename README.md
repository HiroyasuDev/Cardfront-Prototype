For a **Triple Triad** prototype in PICO-8, using separate `.lua` files can be beneficial if you want to keep your code modular and maintainable, especially if the project grows beyond a basic prototype. However, it's also important to consider PICO-8's constraints and the scope of your project.

### When to Use Separate `.lua` Files for a Triple Triad Prototype

Here are some factors that would make it advantageous to use separate `.lua` files:

1. **Code Organization and Readability**:
   - **Grid Logic**: Managing the 3x3 grid, placing cards, and checking for valid moves.
   - **Card Mechanics**: Handling card attributes (e.g., power values, ownership) and card interactions (e.g., flipping).
   - **Game Flow**: Managing the game state, turn logic, and win conditions.
   - **Rendering**: Drawing the grid, cards, and other UI elements.
   
   By separating these into distinct files, you can more easily find and work on specific parts of the game without scrolling through a long file. This approach is especially helpful if you plan to expand the game or add more features.

2. **Reusability and Modular Development**:
   - If you decide to reuse some of the code for another game or project in PICO-8, having separate modules for grid management, card logic, etc., makes it easier to extract and reuse that code.
   - You can build independent features or mechanics (like the card flipping algorithm) in separate files and then include them when needed.

3. **Scalability**:
   - As the game expands to include more features (e.g., AI opponent, advanced rules like "Same" or "Plus"), having modular code helps keep the project manageable. This is particularly useful if you plan to build the game incrementally, adding new rules or mechanics over time.

### When to Keep Everything in `main.lua`

For a small prototype or proof-of-concept, keeping everything in a single file (`main.lua`) may still be a good idea, especially if:

1. **The Project Scope Is Small**:
   - If you only want to implement basic Triple Triad rules (placing cards, flipping adjacent cards) and don't plan on adding more complex features soon, keeping the code in one file can keep things simple.
   
2. **You Want Quick Iteration**:
   - For rapid prototyping and testing, having all the code in one file makes it easy to make changes without managing multiple files.

3. **PICO-8's Token Limit**:
   - PICO-8 has a token limit (8192 tokens), and splitting files does not change the total token count. If your project starts reaching the token limit, you may have to refactor and optimize the code regardless of file structure.

### Suggested Approach

1. **Start Simple, Then Refactor**:
   - Begin with everything in `main.lua`. As you add more features and the codebase grows, identify parts that can be separated into distinct modules (e.g., `grid.lua`, `card.lua`, `game.lua`).
   - Use clear comments and sections in your `main.lua` to organize the code initially.

2. **Suggested File Structure for a Modular Approach**:
   - `main.lua`: Handles the main game loop, initializing modules, and core game functions.
   - `grid.lua`: Manages the 3x3 grid and card placement logic.
   - `card.lua`: Contains functions for creating, managing, and flipping cards.
   - `game.lua`: Implements game flow, such as turn management and win conditions.
   - `draw.lua`: Handles rendering the grid, cards, and any additional UI elements.

3. **Use `#include` to Combine the Files**:
   - PICO-8 supports the `#include` directive for loading multiple files, allowing you to maintain modularity while still working within PICO-8's environment:
     ```lua
     -- In main.lua
     #include grid.lua
     #include card.lua
     #include game.lua
     #include draw.lua
     ```

### Conclusion

For a Triple Triad prototype, starting with a single file and then refactoring into separate files as the project evolves can be a practical approach. This allows you to manage complexity better while still prototyping quickly. If you know you'll be expanding the game's features significantly, adopting a modular structure with separate `.lua` files from the beginning will help maintain code quality and organization.
